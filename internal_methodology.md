# Pentest Methodology
This will address methodology, things to remember, things to try if you're stuck, and things like these during pentests. The focus will be for a 5-day pentest focusing on stealing cardholder data or breaking into a segmented network; however, most of these techniques can be used for any type of offensive security engagement though.

The focus here is on steps to take, tools to run, things to check. Other files in this repo have the specific commands to run. I've linked to those where possible.

## Things to Not Forget
- Day 1: Focus on recon, scanning, and information gathering.
  - [ ] Begin scanning the target network segment to see if anything can reach it
  - [ ] If wireless is in scope, set this up and let it run/capture
  - [ ] Ask a contact to access the target network and verify the way they do it + document -- if remote, get documentation
  - [ ] Map out the network & target environment -- don't worry about exploitation yet, diligence in enumeration will pay off
  - [ ] Start password spraying soon, being mindful of lockout policy (just ask)

- Day 2: Focus on foothold
  - [ ] Attempt to get a foothold/creds if you don't already have one
  - [ ] Once you have a foothold, map out the directory enviro
  
- Day 3-5:
  - [ ] When you can access a bunch of servers, start port scanning from those to the CDE

## Notes before Reporting
- Ensure that IPs, ports, etc match. For instance, go over the IPs and make sure they all actually ARE CDE IPs. If there's question, hash it out with the client.

## Open Source Intelligence
- [ ] Simply *Google the target*. What does the company do? What information do they store/process? What's their business?
- [ ] Check for sensitive documents:
  - [ ] Google: `site:firenation.com filetype:docx` (also: `doc`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `pdf`, etc)
- [ ] Identify high-profile employees (chairman of boards, CEO, CFO, CIO, CISO) or highly-privileged users (sysadmins, netadmins, devs, infosec)
Check photos for metadata or even interesting data captured. Examples could be badges, information on whiteboards, building layout.
- LinkedIn
  - [ ] Check employees. Look for security team, developers, admins. Get a feel for tech stack.
- [ ] Facebook
- [ ] Twitter
- [ ] Instagram
- [ ] Job Postings
  - [ ] What positions do they need filled?
  - [ ] What technology stack are they looking for/skills desired?
  - [ ] Recruiter contact info
- [ ] Emails
  - [ ] `theHarvester`
  - [ ] Other resources for emails: https://hunter.io, LinkedIn, etc.
  - [ ] Have you found any? What's the naming convention? Pull employees from LI and generate a list of usernames/emails for password spraying
- [ ] Harvest creds:
  - [ ] https://haveibeenpwned.com/
  - [ ] https://www.dehashed.com/
  - [ ] https://scylla.sh
- [ ] Github and source code repositories:
  - [ ] Search git for relevant repos
  - [ ] Look for developers identified in OSINT. Sometimes they put secrets or creds in personal repos. Tsk tsk tsk!
  - [ ] Try [`gitleaks`](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) or [`trufflehog`](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog)
- [ ] PasteBin
  - [ ] Check for domains, company names, high-profile employees
- [ ] Cloud checks
  - [ ] Wide open S3 buckets? https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/

## Wireless

## Network Scanning & Enumeration
- [ ] Kick off a Nessus scan if applicable
- [ ] Check for phone attack paths such as [Cisco phones](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/seeyoucm-thief-exploiting-common-misconfigurations-in-cisco-phone-systems/)
- [ ] Scan the CDE/target environment: `masscan -iL cde.txt -p0-65535 -oG masscan-cde-allports`
- [ ] Ping sweep
- [ ] Kick off a big top 1024 scan. Don't forget to log it in case the scans hang up. Increase to `-T5` if you're feeling adventurous:
  ```
  mkdir scans
  nmap -iL subnets-firenation.lst -sV -sC -T4 -oA firenation-sV-sC --open --max-retries 1 --min-parallelism 128 --min-hostgroup 128 -v | tee scans/nmap.log
  ```
- [ ] If network segmentation checks are part of the pentest, then start scanning the target networks asap. If you can do a full `-p-` scan then go for it, but if it's massive, here's the minimum ports you wanna scan:
  ```
  -p21,22,23,25,53,80,111,121,135,139,443,445,1433,1521,2049,3306,3389,4786,5945,5985,8080,8443,9090,9443,9875,2093,49152,902,5900,2000,389,636,8000,10943
  ```
- [ ] Parse through open ports with: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altjx/ipwn/master/nmap_scripts/nmapscrape.rb
- [ ] Perform reverse DNS lookups on the domain: `nmap -iL subnets-firenation.lst -sL -oA dns-lookup`
- [ ] Scan for SMB and for SMB Signing: `crackmapexec smb open-ports/445.txt | tee scans/cme-smb-scan.log`
- [ ] Scan for top MS vulns: `nmap -iL open-ports/445.txt -p445 --script=smb-vuln-ms08-067,smb-vuln-ms17-010 -v | tee scans/nmap-smb-vulns.log`
- [ ] Scan for BlueKeep (Win7 is a win, Win2k8 can DoS)
- [ ] Scan for "easy RCE ports":
  - Java RMI: 1090,1098,1099,4444,11099,47002,10999
  - WebLogic: 7000-7004,8000-8003,9000-9003,9503,7070,7071
  - JDWP: 45000,45001
  - JMX: 8686,9012,50500
  - GlassFish: 4848
  - jBoss: 11111,4444,4445
  - Cisco Smart Install: 4786
  - HP Data Protector: 5555,5556
  - Redis: 6379
  - Gitlab: 
  ```
  nmap -iL corp.lst -Pn -sVC -p1090,1098,1099,4444,11099,47002,10999,7000-7004,8000-8003,9000-9003,9503,7070,7071,45000,45001,8686,9012,50500,4848,11111,4444,4445,4786,5555,5556 -oA scans/nmap-corp-Pn-sVC-easy-rces -v --open -T4
  ```
- [ ] Check for Jenkins instances. Typically runs on TCP/8080 (check `aquatone` output).
- [ ] SNMP checks
- [ ] `rpcclient` Check for NULL sessions, enum info if auth'd
- [ ] KRB guessing
- [ ] Check for database issues:
  - PostgreSQL: check for unauthenticated instances with `postgres:` (MSF module: `auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_login`)
    - **This results in automatic RCE via `COPY TO` if version is >=9.3!**
  - MSSQL: `sa:sa`, `sa:`, and similar (MSF module: `auxiliary/scanner/mssql/mssql_login`)
- [ ] Check for port 12721, java deserialization on vCenter. Can use `nmap -sV --script rmi-* ip` to validate

## Getting a Foothold
- [ ] Begin running [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder):
  ```
  apt update && apt install -y responder
  responder -I eth0 -wrf
  ```
- [ ] Run [mitm6](https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/):
  ```
  pip install mitm6
  mitm6 -i eth0 -d firenation.com --debug 
  ```
  *Note: Every time I've run this, it has caused network disruptions. Proceed with caution and check out params `-hw` and `-hb`*    
- [ ] Relay NTLM authentication from the above poisoning (this specifically is for `mitm6`)
  ```
  ## Should relay to victim via SMB. Needs local admin (I think maybe RID500...need to verify)
  ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -of net-ntlmv2.hsh                   # Attempt to dump SAM 
  ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -of net-ntlmv2.hsh -c "systeminfo"   # Runs "systeminfo". Caught by CrowdStrike.
  ## LDAPS NTLM relay (patches may fix this!). Any Domain User can add up to 10 computers by default. Compy can be used for BloodHound.
  ntlmrelayx.py --ipv6 -wh wpad.firenation.com -t ldaps://dc.firenation.com --add-computer
  ##
  ```
- Multirelay with [new features for `ntlmrelayx.py`](https://www.secureauth.com/blog/what-old-new-again-relay-attack)
- Check for webmail/Exchange -- mailsniper, ruler, etc
    - https://github.com/sensepost/ruler/wiki/Homepage
    - Log in to O365 or internal and own their mailbox
- Check for Zerologon: https://www.secura.com/blog/zero-logon

## Local PrivEsc
- Local priv esc: 
    - https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation
    - https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation
    - https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS
- Check common places for creds:
    - Windows:
      - Sticky notes in sqlite at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite`
      - OneNote
    - Linux:
      - `.bashrc` files
      - Log files

## Domain PrivEsc
- [ ] Run BloodHound
  - Mark owned users and computers as you compromise them
  - Identify abusable attack paths
- [ ] Kerberoasting
- [ ] AS-REP roasting
- [ ] With owned accounts, log in to email and look for secrets. Try `CredSniper.ps1`. Also look at Teams, Skype history, etc. for juicies
- [ ] Identify servers AND users that are configured for unconstrained delegation
- [ ] Identify servers AND users that are configured for constrained delegation
- [ ] Check for SMB signing not required and such. Consider the printer bug and see if you can relay that.
- [ ] Run `CredNinja.py` against the network with the compromised accounts. See if you have local admin and can keep dumping hashes
- [ ] Check for SMB servers. Use `smbclient.py` and `plunder` to search for interesting files in those shares that you can access
- [ ] Check domain 

## Lateral Movement to Restricted Segment
Assuming it's a PCI test, I'll use CDE for restricted segment:
- [ ] Port scan from every machine to target network although this may be inefficient
- [ ] Check for split tunnel VPNs - attempt to enumerate workstations for other interfaces that could be in CDE
- [ ] Identify admins or users with access to CDE and keylog for creds
- [ ] Check netstats from jumpboxes and so forth into the CDE (ex. steal an RDP session via `tscon` or similar)
- [ ] Folder sharing through RDP sessions
- [ ] Pivot through a DC -- many times a DC will have more access into a CDE
- [ ] Identify network devices that could be on the edge of the CDE and see if you can log in
  - [ ] Target network admins to see if you can SSH into FWs and such
- [ ] Check for domain trusts and see if you can abuse
